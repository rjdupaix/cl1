            <p>Morning Star is a wonderful conclusion to the first book of the 'Red Rising' trilogy. Darrow and Mustang's ending will leave you teary eyed and wanting more.
               Paul Pierce did a great job of beautifully wrapping up each character's story in a way that is satisfying and leaving you happy. I recommend this to anyone interested
               in modern sci-fy or fantasy.</p>

            <div class="review-content">
            <p>Mort is a wonderful beginning to Terry Pratchett's story of Death. You would think that Death has everything figured out, seeing as he is an eternal being. Mort comes
               to see and know that this isn't the case though. This story following Death's existential crisis of learning what it is like to be human is excited, fun, and all aroung
               entertaining.</p>

            <p>Victor Frankl's tale of life in the concentration camps at times is very dark as you would expect. Yet, he found a way to keep hope within the reader through writing
               about where his head was at. Whether it was in a dark place or he was writing about the hope and joy he found in something as little and small as a crusty and stale
               piece of bread. It truly is a master piece from which we can all find hope.</p>
